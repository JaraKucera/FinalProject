I'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.

While running game code:
  File "game/script.rpy", line 63, in script
    "By looking at the camp, you could tell that in the past it must have been filled with joyous souls of children laughing about, enjoying their summers, stress-free and happy."
IOError: Couldn't find file 'audio/CampAmbi'.
