# The Red Scarf
A visual novel game created in the Ren'Py engine. A story about being brought to a summer camp for unknown reasons. Under certain circumstances the protagonist comes across a girl that may be the only reason why he is still alive, there is something that she is hiding though. 
A final year project created by Jaroslav Kucera. This game is centured around the brief:

“ Mental Health problems affect about one in ten children and young people. They include depression, anxiety, and conduct disorder, and are often a direct response to what is happening in their lives. The emotional well-being of children is just as important as their physical health. Good mental health allows children and young people to develop the resilience to cope with whatever life throws at them and grow into well-rounded, healthy adults”

The game is about interacting with a person that is dealing with depression. Your actions will change her emotional state which will then have an impact on the progression of the story. The game will take note of how you treat this person and will analyse your actions at the end of the game. It will also try to see if you show signs of depression through the particular choices that you make.
The choices that you make while playing this game impact the girls moods. Staying alive all depends on how you treat the girl. Once the game ends, all of your choices will be analysed, and you'll be told if your character is good at treating people and if they show signs of depression.

The purpose of this project is to create a game centered around depression and anxiety, where the player interacts with a video game character who is affected by depression. Through this interaction, the player will learn how to help people dealing with depression and how to identify symptoms.  In this game,  the player will be prompted with choices that will not only impact the person they are helping but themselves. Essentially, the choices which the player makes will help to identify symptoms of depression in the player themselves. Meanwhile, the results at the end of the game will provide analytics of their behaviour towards themselves and the character in need. Information will be provided based on these choices that will reveal the best way to deal with the situations presented to the player. 
###### Current features:
